This repository contains code and data files of the project "Membership Inference Attack on Tree-based Models Leveraging Structural White-box Information".

### Project Description:
In this project, we implement membership inference attacks on tree-based models leveraging white-box information about the target model. Membership inference attacks exploit the model's stored information on it's training dataset to infer the membership of an instance. Formally, the adversary aims to predict whether a certain record, r, was used to train the target model, M, using some auxiliary knowledge.
